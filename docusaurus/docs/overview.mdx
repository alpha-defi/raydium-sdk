title: SDK Overview
---

The [Raydium software development kit (SDK)](https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-sdk/) provides
APIs for building applications on top of Raydium.

At a high level, it provides classes, utilities, and types
for token swaps, liquidity, farms, SPL (Solana Program Library) utilities, 
tokens, and more. The SDK is used extensively by the [Raydium V2 frontend](https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-frontend).

See the [showcase](/showcase) for examples of applications
built on top of Raydium and then visit the [guides](/guides) and [API](/api) section
to create your own applications!
