title: Embedded React

(Under construction).

One possible way to integrate the Raydium swap widget is to embed
a copy of the [raydium-frontend](https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-frontend) project
into your existing project. The advantage with this approach is that it uses the exact
same code that the Raydium frontend uses. 

There are several downsides though:

1. There may be extra bloat with duplicate libraries
2. Global JS or CSS conflicts with existing application
