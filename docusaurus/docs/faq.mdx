### What is the difference between swap, route swap, and trade swap?

These are different terms for the primary swap operations provided by the 
Raydium SDK:


### Swap

Invokes Liquidity.makeSwapTransaction function that swaps for single pool 
(e.g. swap RAY to USDC via the RAY-USDC pool) 


### Route Swap

Invokes Route.makeSwapTransaction that uses two pools. For example, a route swap
of RAY to FTT requires the following two steps:

a) Swap RAY to USDC via the RAY-USDC pool
b) Swap USDC to FTT using the FTT_USDC pool

### Trade Swap

Invokes Liquidity.makeTradeTransaction
